# UVa Online Judge Solutions
My solutions to the UVa Online Judge problems.

- The program names match the corresponding problem number in the [UVa Online Judge](https://onlinejudge.org).
- Programs need to be compiled with GNU C++ Compiler that supports C++ 11 or above, because of the header file `#include<bits/stdc++.h>` to include all STL containers and algorithms,
in order to increase development time.
- "-2" in the program name means an alternative approach to the problem.
- "AOAPC II" in the comment refers to the book "Beginning Algorithms Contests II Edition" by Rujia Liu (《算法竞赛入门经典（第2版）》，刘汝佳).
Problems that appear in examples of Liu's book got inspirations from the book and [his solutions](https://github.com/aoapc-book/aoapc-bac2nd).
Many problems that appear in the exercises were inspired by the accompany solutions manual by Feng Chen (《算法竞赛入门经典习题与解答》，陈锋)
and [his code](https://github.com/sukhoeing/aoapc-bac2nd-keys). Thanks!
